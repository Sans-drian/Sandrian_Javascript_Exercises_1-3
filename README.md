Sandrian Wardana [2052016411] - Javascript Exercises 1-3 - L1BC

As of updating this at 11:52AM, this github repository will still be empty. I will upload the javascript files before the end of the day, but I will be posting the repository link before noon.

At 12/17/2021 9:06 AM, I have uploaded both practice 2 and 3. I apologize that I didn't realize that I haven't done so earlier. I also have clarified some notes in the code for some context of how I completed the code.
